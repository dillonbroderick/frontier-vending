    <h1>The U.S. Dollar</h1>

    <div class="top">
        <h2>Where It Started</h2>

        <p class="ptext">
            Following the ratification of the Constitution in 1788,
            the <span class="act">Mint Act</span> of 1792 was passed. This act solidified the
            monetary system of the United States and declared the dollar
            to be the primary unit for the system.
        </p>

        <h2>Notable Events</h2>

        <p class="ptext">
            In 1873, the <span class="act">Coinage Act</span> was passed. The objective of this act 
            was to shift the United States from a coinage system utilizing both
            gold and silver to a system relying entirely on the gold standard.
        </p>

        <p class="ptext">
            The <span class="act">Federal Reserve Act</span> (also known as "The Fed") was passed in 1913.
            This act created a central bank to oversee the monetary system in hopes
            of influencing economic stability.
        </p>

        <p class="ptext">
            In 1971, the United States under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock#:~:text=Nixon%20directed%20Treasury%20Secretary%20Connally,exchange%20their%20dollars%20for%20gold.">President Nixon ended its use of the
            gold standard</a>. This terminated the convertibility of the US dollar to gold.
            Additionally, this effectively ended the Bretton Woods system.
        </p>

        <h2>Where it is Now</h2>

        <p class="ptext">
            Today, the US dollar's value is volatile, but it remains a primary and dominant
            currency around the globe. A key factor in the US dollar we know today is its
            involvement in oil exchange. Oil-producing countries are paid in US dollars
            which are more commonly known as petrodollars in this context. All oil-purchasing 
            countries must acquire the US dollar in order to pay for oil which reinforces US's
            dollar's global dominance.
